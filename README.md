==================================

Tested on Roundcube 1.2-beta

Mabola is a clean and usable skin for latest Roundcube Webmail (http://roundcube.net). Is based on Material Design, Bootstrap and inherits from Larry Skin, so there should be no unstyled content.

It supports Threecol plugin. Check it out at EstudioNexos/threecol.
